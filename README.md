# SeeYou
This is a project from the faculty in the 2nd semester of the 2nd year at the course named ”Software development methods”.
It has 2 parts:
  1. Web video call application for registered users
  2. Global chat server, made in Java
  
Below you can find the demo for the video call website, the demo for the Java chat server and afterwards you can find out project requirements and details.

### Web video call demo

1. [Prezentare toata aplicatia si video call fara perspectiva celei de-a 2-a persoana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz1aeF_-MKc)
2. [Prezentarea functionalitate de video call si de la a 2-a persoana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHIzn2DYtIU)

### Global chat server demo

1. [Demo - 3 users on chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyoA-qPEs8o&feature=youtu.be)

## Requirements

Software development process - grade between 1 and 10
It consists of the following parts:

1. user stories (minimum 10), backlog creation - 2 pts
2. design/architecture/UML - 2 pts
3. source control (branch creation, merge/rebase, minimum 10 commits) - 2 pts
4. automation testing (unit or integration) - minimum 5 - 3 pts
5. bug reporting - 1 pt
6. using a build tool - 1 pt
7. refactoring (minimum 1), code standards - 1 pt
8. design patterns - 1 pt

Observation: It is not a mistake that the sum of the points is 13, not 10. In this way you can choose which sub-points you make to get a grade of 10.

## Project idea

1. For the web application: implement the feature of a video call in a website. Only allow this for registered users that will log in. Users can have and add friends. The landing page of the website must be a presentation of the entire product.
2. For the java application: implement the feature of global chatting between users that want to talk.

## Project team

For the web application:

1. Gabriel Arghire (me) - frontend and backend
2. Ștefan Chițu ([github profile](https://github.com/jaoc12)) - backend, SQL queries and database design
3. Daniel Simionov ([github profile](https://github.com/DanielM24)) - voice recognition with AI (implemented but not integrated)

For the Java global chat server:

1. Adrian Olaru ([github profile](https://github.com/adrianolaru99))
2. Florin Emanuel Laiu ([github profile](https://github.com/florinlaiu))

Each member contribution can be seen on his own branch, mentioning that at some point in the history of this repository commits I have made a bad push and some contributions of team members have been erased on the main branch.

1. [justicebringer](https://github.com/JusticeBringer/SeeYou/tree/justicebringer) -> Arghire Gabriel
2. [SQL](https://github.com/JusticeBringer/SeeYou/tree/SQL) -> Stefan Chitu
3. [daniel](https://github.com/JusticeBringer/SeeYou/tree/daniel) -> Simionov Daniel
4. [java](https://github.com/JusticeBringer/SeeYou/tree/java) -> Olaru Adrian and Laiu Florin

**Note:** The second part of the project (the java chat server) is implemented [in this repository](https://github.com/adrianolaru99/Proiect-MDS), but has also been committed here, so the entire project can be seen on this single repository.
